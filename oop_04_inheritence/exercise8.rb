Given the following code...

bob = Person.new
bob.hi

And the corresponding error message...

NoMethodError: private method `hi' called for #<Person:0x007ff61dbb79f0>
from (irb):8
from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-rc2/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'

What is the problem and how would you go about fixing it?
=end

#Answer
#In the example, the object bob attempts to call a private method directly
#Write a method to call the private method from within the class or make the private method public
