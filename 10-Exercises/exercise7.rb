Exercise 7
What's the major difference between an Array and a Hash?
	
An array includes a list of values. The order of those values is maintained 
through the use of indexes. Indexes also facilitate value retrieval.

A hash maintains a list of values that can be accessed via a key. The hash
does not necessarily maintain the order of key / value pairs.
