Exercise 11
Look at several Rails/Ruby online API sources 
and say which one you like best and why.


Ruby-doc.org is probably the best resource I have used. It seems to be
comprehensive and well organized.

http://api.rubyonrails.org/ didn't seem as well organized or the content just isn't 
as comprehensive.

I haven't found anything else that seems terribly useful via Google search.
